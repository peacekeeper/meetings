  the credentials landscape in Europe.
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  We now have a good 50 minutes for 
  Simone_Ravaioli's topic and Q&A.

Topic: Guest expert Simone Ravaioli discusses European Credentialing Landscape

Simone Ravaoli: 
  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QQSZgiggrRMSh6NKdn0nvW3MYxQDIFCL6gS75nd34PE/edit?usp=sharing
Simone Ravaoli:  [In a dramatic echoing room]. I'll share a link 
  in the chat to a document we can use for reference as we go 
  through what I want to cover.
Simone_Ravaioli [we lost his audio]
Simone_Ravaioli is back
<anillewis> Hi My name is Anil Lewis. I am a senior architect in 
  IBM and working on the learner credential network using 
  Hyperledger Indy
Simone Ravaoli:  What I wanted to do is take this opportunity to 
  share with the group about the credentialing landscape in Europe, 
  as I have experienced it the last 12-13 years.
<kimhd> reminder ottonomy, feel free to scribe lightly where the 
  content is captured in Simone's doc
Simone Ravaoli:  By no means is this intended to be a 
  comprehensive record of what happened. This is what I've seen. 
  Many of the people on the call have contributed to this work.
Simone Ravaoli:  I'll list and quickly address some of the 
  technical specs I've seen surface in Europe over the years. Then 
  I will mention some of the high-level European initiatives that 
  are pertinent to what we are looking at here, as well as some of 
  the more grassroots projects that are relevant.
Simone Ravaoli:  Then we will open it up for discussion to see if 
  there are action items for us to take this forward.
Simone Ravaoli:  The space is lively, I would say. Some 
  initiatives early on, starting around 2000. The stuff in the 
  document, some of it is ...out of our collective memory of what 
  happened, then moving into more recent stuff.
Simone Ravaoli:  The first ones CDM, XCRI are around course 
  metadata, describing what is happening in a course. This was 
  eventually picked up in the UK by JISC, who started to work on 
  another version, which they called the XCRI. At the same time, 
  work was going on in Germany to describe learning content, as 
  well as in Sweden.
Kim Hamilton Duffy: Reminder to all, here is the talk outline: 
  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QQSZgiggrRMSh6NKdn0nvW3MYxQDIFCL6gS75nd34PE/edit#heading=h.gjdgxs
Simone Ravaoli:  CEN started a project for harmonization, called 
  MLO Metadata for Learning Opportunity. This is where I got 
  involved. If you're familiar with learning in Europe, you're 
  familiar with the Erasmus scheme, which provides funding for 
  student learning. There was a desire to extend the Erasmus 
  experience in a meaningful way.
Simone Ravaoli:  This produced a European norm, which was the 
  MLO. Then the issue started to move to adoption. There was some 
  great work that was going to harmonize existing workstreams in 
  Europe, but the traction needed for it to have an impact was not 
  there. Fortunately a group of implementers in the higher 
  education space, SIS vendors, stepped into this conversation and 
  provided the necessary conduit into the market.
Simone Ravaoli:  They were able to contribute to the evolution of 
  the specification and inherited a responsibility to take this to 
  market, at least to use it in their systems to support the 
  Erasmus program. MLO was the first proper standard involved in 
  this.
Simone Ravaoli:  MLO did relate to another stream of work, 
  EuroLMAI for European Learner Mobility, which really added the 
  achievements piece. These were two standards that became very 
  important for the evolution of this conversation in Europe. The 
  specification work was picked up by grassroots organizations 
  implementing a very bottom-up approach to implement and pilot the 
  specs.
Simone Ravaoli:  At the time I was working for a consortium of 
  public universities in Europe. The organizations addressed what 
  went into the interoperability. There were a few pilots, and they 
  looked to adopt the available specifications. This lasted for a 
  few years without much uptake.
Simone Ravaoli:  The traction created by some of the vendors 
  raised an issue (for some time it had become a lobbying exercise) 
  to create appropriate funding schemes for this kind of work. Up 
  to them there wasn't much funding within the Erasmus program for 
  technical work (most funding was for research).
Simone Ravaoli:  There was a related instrument, Horizon 2020, 
  but it wasn't a good fit for this work.
Simone Ravaoli:  At some stage, the European Commission picked up 
  on what was happening, and started to create a couple 
  opportunities for funds to be allocated to this work. The first 
  project was EMREX, supporting the EuroLMAI work. They are similar 
  in effort, but different in how the model was implemented, but 
  they both received two rounds of funding.
Simone Ravaoli:  While EMREX was focused on implementing one of 
  the specifications, another effort ELMO was more learner focused, 
  giving learners access to their data.
Simone Ravaoli:  This initiative (ELMO) was in favor with 
  leadership and received several rounds of funding and is still 
  with us. There is a technical component of this, which hopefully 
  will be able to implement the technical architecture created 
  through EMREX.
Simone Ravaoli:  This was a first approach to keep this 
  credentialing movement together. There was an effort to map ELMO 
  to PESC, to synchronize credentials work between Europe and the 
  US.
Simone Ravaoli:  This was not a super sexy thing in the market. 
  But a few of us stuck with it, feeling it was important to 
  support across organizations. People trying to get the 
  interoperability thing done. Paying attention to movers and 
  shakers in North America. This is a global movement. As much as a 
  standard can be made anywhere in the world, adoption becomes an 
  issue.
Simone Ravaoli:  How can we crosswalk among standards? We believe 
  there is a piece of work that needs to be addressed there.
Simone Ravaoli:  Digital credentials picked up momentum a few 
  years ago, with hype around blockchain. There was a clear use 
  case in education for blockchain. There were many initiatives 
  springing up, and a parallel effort to try to "keep it together".
Simone Ravaoli:  I always felt it was important to document what 
  was happening in Europe, also tracking who was supporting 
  initiatives, especially in the European Commission. This brings 
  us to this conversation today, where we hopefully can find the 
  right people to keep these initiatives connected and help with 
  harmonization and crosswalking of these different pieces of work.
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  I hadn't realized there was an effort to 
  harmonize with PESC already. We're trying to bring together 
  people who want to harmonize the content of the claim (IEEE). At 
  W3C we've been more focused on the wrapper. +1 to keeping some 
  momentum going for global interoperable standards.
Simone Ravaoli:  When you think about Europe, there is an 
  expectation that the European Commission, the higher authorities 
  will do something to stimulate the effort. There are several 
  entities involved.
Simone Ravaoli:  The DGs are directors of the different work 
  areas focused by the commission. We have DG for Education, DG for 
  Employment and DG Connect, which is looking at the digital 
  transformation for the Commission.
Simone Ravaoli:  Within the DG for Employment, one of the major 
  efforts that is ongoing is the Europass project. Europass is an 
  existing flagship project of the Commission, running for 14 
  years. It is a portfolio/document platform. This platform has 
  been in open heart surgery for several months now; new version 
  will be published around May.
Simone Ravaoli:  This new endeavor involves focus on a new 
  Europass Digital Credentials Infrastructure (EDCI)
Simone Ravaoli:  Some of the experts from that effort are on this 
  call. This new specification will be extremely important down the 
  road. Also, as a result of the European Blockchain Service 
  Infrastructure work, that led to 4 different use cases, one of 
  them diplomas.
<anthonyfcamilleri> That's an excellent way to characterise the 
  difference Simone
Simone Ravaoli:  As you've seen this effort can be approached 
  from different angles. If the EDCI is looking at the content of a 
  claim, the EBSI is looking at the envelope for the claim. There 
  is some coordination between these efforts; hopefully they will 
  be able to go forward hand in hand.
Simone Ravaoli:  I'll call out in the document a number of 
  projects around EDCI in Europe (feel free to add to this document 
  if you know others). One honorable mention to touch on: an 
  important element of developing the credentialing landscape in 
  Europe was the Rome Student Systems and Standards Group RS3G.
Simone Ravaoli:  RS3G was the seat of several projects that 
  followed that. You may have heard of the Groningen Declaration 
  Network, which is now an established initiative with global 
  reach.
Simone Ravaoli:  EMREX was originally "RS3G Mobility Project".
Simone Ravaoli:  So this is a bit of a slide over what has been 
  happening in Europe. Let me call out my European colleagues on 
  the call. Anyone want to add?
Leonard Rosenthal:  Simone, could you comment: One of my biggest 
  concerns is the relation between this work and EIDIS (sp?). 
  WIthout that alignment we can't use these credentials legally in 
  the EU?
<kimhd> I think Nacho Alamillo is doing a lot of work on that?
Simone Ravaoli:  Lots of issues roll up to "identity". Some work 
  has been done on European Blockchain Partnership on Self 
  Sovereign Identity. There is ongoing work to look at that and to 
  see how an SSI layer could be wrapped around this. There are 
  national initiatives and centralized European efforts.
Anthony Camilleri: @Lenoardr if I may supplement this: Europass 
  Digitally Signed Credentials will require signature using an 
  eIDAS compliant digital signature/seal. so all Europass DSC will 
  have legal value from launch in May.
<larinyo_> Within EBSI the so called eIDas bridge is been 
  developed, so for the so called VeID it will be possible to have 
  a trustframework to enabkle legally VCs
S/EIDIS/eIDAS
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Nacho Alamillo is doing some work in the 
  concept of the European SSI framework and eIDAS specifically 
  around levels of assurance. Looking forward to that.
Simone Ravaoli:  The SSI work at the European level is also 
  looking at other similar initiatives, particular what is going on 
  in Canada with the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework (sp?). There are 
  more initiatives trying this model and adding the SSI element 
  into it. Certainly Nacho is working on one and presenting soon on 
  a webinar.
Jim Goodell:  Simone, you mentioned one of the projects on the 
  "envelope?" Could you same more about where they are and timing?
<juancaballero> Nacho is speaking on Alex Preukschat's Webinar 
  series tomorrow!
Juan Caballero: 
  https://ssimeetup.org/eidas-regulation-anchoring-trust-self-sovereign-identity-systems-ignacio-alamillo-webinar-49/
Simone Ravaoli:  One of the use cases under the European 
  Blockchain Service Infrastructure. Can I call on Louis to speak 
  up?
<kimhd> thanks Juan!
Simone Ravaoli:  Louis is leading this work
Louis (sp?): Yes, Nacho Alamillo is leading this team with EBSI. 
  There is also another project the so called eIDAS Bridge, which 
  will let us link to qualified service providers to sign 
  verifiable credentials. This will let us extend the eIDAS Trust 
  Framework to the Verifiable Credentials landscape.
<juancaballero> It's Lluís (double-L)
Louis (sp?): EBSI has standardized a "envelope" to containerize 
  and transport information. The contents of the credentials are 
  described using the Europass EDCI standard.
<kimhd> s/Louis/Lluís
Llúis: On Feb 12 the membership of EDCI was opened for member 
  states. On March 24 there will be a meeting in Brussels where 
  there will be open source software announced and made available 
  on GitHub. then anyone can see what is there and make use of all 
  the code.
Kim Hamilton Duffy: I stumbled across this recently, note VCs as 
  xml: 
  https://github.com/european-commission-europass/EDCI-Data-Model
<snorre> Is this Github repo he mentioned something that will be 
  linked to somehow?
Llúis: The interoperability between different DLTs... first 
  version of EBSI there are two DLTs (__ and hyperledger fabric), 
  the identity for entities for any DID is based on the Ethereum 
  platform. Another use case: documents to be notarized are on 
  Hyperledger fabric DLT. EBSI is the "envelope" for all these and 
  for how entities should be described in Verifiable Credentials.]
<jim_goodell> Thank you Llúis !
Llúis: How to describe any educational claim is from the Europass 
  EDCI
<juancaballero> Sn/orre, I believe the repos go public later?
BlazPodgorelec: Here is one point missed so far, Main Digital 
  Europe for All, which is going to implement a pilot across four 
  universities in Europe. One main point is the bridge between 
  eIDAS bridge to Self-sovereign identities.
Juan Caballero: https://www.de4a.eu/
BlazPodgorelec: There is also CDCX which is piloted in four 
  universities in different countries; implements blockchain ERC721 
  token
<anthonyfcamilleri> @blazpodgorelec is the ERC-721 initiative 
  linked to credentify/0xcert?
<blazpodgorelec> @AnthonyFCamilleri https://eductx.org/
Simone Ravaoli:  BlazPodgorelec this is great. In the last couple 
  years there has been an outburst of different initiatives funded 
  by different instruments of the EC. Maybe you could add it to the 
  document I shared. This may create a huge list of initiatives, 
  that have the one feature to be connected to funds from the 
  Commission. I think there is a sustainability issue. They create 
  pilots that go well in a network, but how to scale and make 
  interoperable!
Juan Caballero:  EIDAS for people listening in, is a little 
  uneven from country to country. Countries that have been 
  investing in a lot of eIDAS compliant infrastructure all along 
  (and have eIDAS contractors and companies and private sector 
  parties willing to experiment) are at the forefront of this 
  (Spain). Germany is desperate to catch up and is funding at the 
  federal level companies to catch up (or "meet them halfway"). 
  Hopefully this will be less uneven
A few years from now.
<juancaballero> it's not me!
WHo was that last on the queue?
<juancaballero> that was me
(Oh, it is just the noise that is not you)
Kim Hamilton Duffy: 
  https://github.com/european-commission-europass/EDCI-Data-Model
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  AnthonyFCamilleri might not be able to talk 
  over voice, but I did find.. some people were asking about GitHub 
  repos referenced, and I found the link above.
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  What I found really interesting is that they 
  are expressing VCs as XML instead of the JSON and JSON-LD 
  expressions we have broadly seen. VC is just a data model, so it 
  is valid to express in XML. As we start moving forward, are we 
  going to find communities or systems who find this easier to 
  express as XML because they're more familiar with it, or the time 
  to take to port their existing systems to JSON might be more 
  work.
<anthonyfcamilleri> I will add on this, reason for expressing VCs 
  as XML is that eIDAS signatures only support standards for 
  signature as XML for signatures embedded in the filed (XADES 
  standards). There is no eIDAS JSON standard.
<anthonyfcamilleri> @Kim that is our official repo of the project
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  I'm curious if anyone can provide more 
  context on that repo or project.
<anthonyfcamilleri> An Interoperability portal will be linked to 
  go on with it in the coming weeks
<blazpodgorelec> @larinyo can you share some info with me about 
  eIDAS Bridge? pls
Leonardr_: Anthony is correct that at this moment there is no 
  JSON signature standard. We have an early draf of a JADES (sp?) 
  standard, but today you would not be able to do it in JSON 
  because there isn't a standard yet.
<jim_goodell> Thinking about a case where a universal JSON 
  wrapper that could carry an encoded XML payload.
<anthonyfcamilleri> @leonardr would love to follow up about this 
  work off call. Would appreciate if you drop me a line 
  (anthony@camilleri.com)
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Yes, that's a struggle that we are 
  encountering. For JSON-LD there is a set of signature suites. For 
  people using JSON, they typically use JWT for signatures. The 
  format and signature suites are part of what might be making them 
  more comlicated.
Leonardr_: None of those JSON-based things have been standardized 
  in the context of the European Commission
Juan Caballero: +1
<=> Current work for the actual revision of the eIdas standard 
  (just started) & eIdas bridge
<=> reach me at lluisalfons.arino@urv.cat
Simone Ravaoli:  A couple more things as we close the hour. 
  Arguably, speaking on the EDCI data model, that is the official 
  github and it is open for people logging issues. Some of the 
  issues I hope people should log are issues that we'd hope people 
  would resolve in the next version of EDCI
Simone Ravaoli:  It would be good to have a mapping exercise, 
  similar to what EdMatrix or what Credential Engine competency 
  mapping work has done.
Simone Ravaoli:  I would start from the 3 that are relevant and 
  being used.
<juancaballero> EDCI + EBSI + EMREX
<juancaballero> (are the 3 he said to start from)
Simone Ravaoli:  Another action item: involve experts who are not 
  yet involved in this call to deep dive into topics that we 
  touched on like EDCI, EMREX.
(Thanks @juancaballero )
<juancaballero> (it takes a village, @ottonomy ;D )
<jim_goodell> T3 Innovation Network is also doing cross-standards 
  mapping...follow-on from the Credential Engine mapping.
Simone Ravaoli:  Look at the issue globally, understanding that 
  there are two epicenters.
Anthony Camilleri: Happy to give one at a future meeting :-)
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Those are great suggestions. One: the 
  mapping similar to Edmatrix -- there is a lot of meaty efforts 
  that are mature. But there are other efforts described here that 
  we don't have equivalents of in North America. +1 to have a deep 
  dive on EDCI (the others as well). But EDCI is making design 
  decisions and actually building a verifiable credential. We could 
  benefit a lot from that conversation.

ACTION: kimhd to book @AnthonyFCamilleri to speak on a future 
  call.

<simone_ravaioli> thx @AnthonyDCamilleri
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  There are also efforts in Singapore that 
  would be good to bring into the conversation.
<juancaballero> thx @AnthonyDCamilleri ! looking forward
<larinyo_> sorry guys, I have to commute to another meeting
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Thanks to Simone to presenting in and 
  bringing in other experts.
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  To folks outside of Europe, this can seem 
  like an alphabet soup of acronyms, thanks for making sense of it 
  and showing relations.
